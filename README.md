# BikeSharingDemandPrediction
- This project is part of Machine Learning course (CSCI 5622) at University of Colorado Boulder
- In this assignment, I developed a regression model that predicts the number of bikes shared from a Seoul Bike Sharing program.
- The data used is subset of `Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Data Set` in UCI repository sampled by instructor.
- It comprised of 13 features and ranges from `1/12/2017` to `30/11/2018`.
- The final metric used was `r-squared` score.
- I recieved `0.93150` for a public and `0.94145` for a private leaderboard using XGBoost model after fine-tuning the parameters.
